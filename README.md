# 3k-Steeplechase-Predictor-2023
Personal project for me that uses a 1500m, 3000m, and 5000m to predict what a male individual in the NCAA would run in the 3000m Steeplechase.

The data for this project is from https://www.tfrrs.org/lists/3711/2022_NCAA_Division_I_Outdoor_Qualifying_FINAL?gender=m


The website for the actual Steeplechase regression can be found at
